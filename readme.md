## What is this?

This is just a repo containing design pattern examples from the book "Head First Design Patterns - A Brain-Friendly Guide". The examples in the book are written in Java, however this repo is written in C#. I followed the examples pretty closely but did make some design decisions to improve code quality and/or to utilize features available in .NET.
